Dustin did a fantastic job assessing the loss, working with the insurance adjuster, getting us on the calendar, and making sure everything was just as it had been before. The crew who did the roofing was very professional and the clean-up was wonderful. The lady in scheduling who helped us get all this done before our desired date was so kind. The gentleman who came to make the final inspection was very friendly and the fact that someone &#8220;double-checked&#8221; the finished product made us feel very comfortable about choosing Belmont.</em></p>

With our very dry July in Lincoln, this is the first time it’s rained since you’ve done the additional work. We are very impressed with the difference between the original roof replacement and the additional work that we had originally intended. Thank you so much for making it right!

                            <p>Just a quick note to let you know how extremely pleased Joni and I were with the tearoff and reroof job Belmont did for us today. I was the general contractor for the construction and addition to our home, and you are the best of any contractor I have worked with. You scheduled us today, were here on time, and finished the job in one day. Looks great, and not a stray nail or scrap in sight. Many thanks!</p>

It was amazing how quickly and efficiently the new roofs were put on all three buildings in our complex, and the clean up each day was wonderful. We appreciate the extra things you did for us, such as coming to the meeting of the association members and working so graciously with us in every manner. When it comes to roofing, it is hard to believe there is a better person or company to work with than Mike Hansen and Belmont Roofing. Thank you for everything.<b><i><br /></i></b></p>

She is a single mom and works for the Family Council and relies on donations for her salary, but she loves the job they also have a house of prayer in the old home that someone had given them at 11th and E. I hope you are still in business when she will need a new roof. The POGO is just for old Dad to say thanks.</p>

                            <p>Mike, I am so glad Willie (Mike Williams – ABC Siding) recommended your company for my roofing job. I had other people give your company very high recommendations and I understand why they did. Jason Williams came to my house and gave me an estimate along with an explanation of all the items this would cover. He was also very flexible with me as to the start time of the project. When Adam and his crew came to replace the shingles he called me with a few additional issues. He explained everything to me in detail and in a way I could understand the issue. His crew was very polite and I love how everything was cleaned up after they had the job done. Please pass this on to Jason and Adam. They are great guys to work with. I will be recommending Belmont Roofing to everyone looking for a roofing company. Mike, Once again thank you for a great job and sending a great crew.</p>

                            <p>Approximately a year ago I decided to have my roof redone – quite an investment considering my home is 6,000+ sq. ft. and the roof material is cedar shake. After interviewing several contractors, I decided to go with Belmont – not the lowest price but by far the best resume and positive references – also being a family business was a real plus. I accepted your proposal and we agreed that the work would be done, weather allowing, as soon as possible. It’s now been almost a year since the work had been completed. So far my house is still standing and the new roof has not blown off – not bad considering the winds we’ve had this year. Now that I’m totally confident that the work performed was the highest quality I could have hoped for, I thought it time to send this note of thanks to you and your entire crew for the work that was done. We have a $1 million home with a roof that makes it look great! From Judi and I, Merry Christmas and our best wishes to you and your family for a safe prosperous future.</p>

                            <p>Mike &amp; Family, I saw Luke’s ad on TV about “Roof for Troops”. Congrats and good for you guys! It really touched my heart, as I know it will for others. I know you are a caring Christian family and conduct your business in that manner. Luke’s a nice, good-looking young man — must be second generation, right? Best regards to all of you and God bless.</p>

They came and did a crack job and completed the entire job by around 4pm. Everything was picked up and cleaned up as if they were never here and now the home has a beautiful new roof. It’s raining today so the timing to do the job yesterday was perfect! I thank Adam for contacting me and working to schedule the job for yesterday. Thank you and Belmont for your professionalism, quick response and quality work. I will definitely recommend your services going forward. Please thank Adam for me, he was also very friendly and professional and I want to let him know his roof crew did an excellent job! Thanks again and have a productive day!</p>

                            <p>My wife and I are extremely pleased with all of the work which you and your people did, and the way in which you accomplished this task. First, your help in the selection of the shingle color was excellent. We are most pleased with your suggestions. Secondly, you said we were going to get a new roof, not just new singles, and we did. This obviously included new color matched flashing, new color matched roof vents, the complete tearoff, the painting of stacks, and the re-nailing of the gut­ters. All of this looks wonderful and the quality of the work was superb. Third, we are amazed at the speed with which you accomplished this job – finished in one day. The efficiency of the work was great and the quality was not compromised. Finally, my own son worked for a roofer when he was in high school and my experience with his work indicated that this is a very dirty and messy job, with lots of debris scattered around the lawn and in plantings. I arrived home expecting that my wife and I would spend some time going around the house and picking up many small bits of materials which your clean up would miss. Much to my surprise, we couldn’t find one thing, not a nail, a staple, a piece of shingle nothing. Your attention to not only the quality of the work, but to our whole house was great.</p>

                            <p>Thanks again for a magnificent job. You can quote my note to Bob from the insurance company. I want to thank you for recommending Mike Hansen and Belmont Roofing to put the new roof on my home. He was one of the nicest persons I have ever met. Not only that, he did what he said he would and in the time that he said he would do it. He had seven young men who were just tremen­dous. There was no loud talking, no foul language, no blaring music, but just hard working young men. Even my neighbors were impressed.</p>

                            <p>Within three days between a blizzard meltdown and thunderstorms Belmont’s craftsmen produced beautiful roof profiles all around our multi-angled house. Our choice of a large New England style shingle required special training for the roofers. They gave us their best competently, efficiently, cleanly. The conscientiousness of Mike Hansen and his company ranks at the top as our Mother asserted a few years ago when Belmont did her roof – and, as we know, Moms are never wrong!</p>

                            <p>My husband and I are extremely pleased with all the assistance we received in planning for our new roof. Jason Williams was so professional and knowledgeable in working with us. He was so prompt in helping us with the defective shingles which had been used in our last roofing job. The roofing crew did an excellent job and was so efficient and hard working. I was amazed how rapidly the job was completed and the entire cleanup was taken care of.</p>

                            <p>Another roofing company tried to sell me an entirely new roof for around $5500. They didn’t even try to talk to me about options, nor did they look at the problems from the inside of the house. Your guy, I think it was Jason, was very helpful and honest. Belmont did a great job in bidding the (repair) job and doing the work. You can use me for a recommendation whenever you want!</p>
